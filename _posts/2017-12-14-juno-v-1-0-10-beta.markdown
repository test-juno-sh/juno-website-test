#### What's new
* CoCalc integration! [CoCalc](http://cocalc.com) is a cloud computing environment that you can now use as a backend in Juno. Simply log in or register with CoCalc and access all your projects as Jupyter Notebook instances.
* Better connection checker. It now explicitly tells you if your certificate is invalid.
* Improves handling of server and notebook connections.
* Fixes a number of smaller bugs and issues reported by our beta testers.

#### Public beta
If you would like to participate and try out **Juno** early, simply [sign up here](/#mce-EMAIL){:target="_blank"} and don't forget to confirm your e-mail address. We will then send you instructions on how to install **Juno** build on your iPad. You will also get updates with new features as soon as they go live.
