Today we are thrilled and excited to announce **Juno**, a Jupyter Notebook client for iPad!

## What is Juno
**Juno** is an iPad app, a client for Jupyter Notebook â€” it lets you connect to a remote Jupyter notebook server and do everything you do with Jupyter on desktop, anywhere. **Juno** features full hardware keyboard support with all familiar Jupyter shortcuts, a responsive and tablet-friendly interface with smooth scrolling, and iOS multitasking support for modes like Split-screen, so that you can run notebooks with documentation, terminal, or other editor in front of you. More features to follow prior to **Juno** AppStore release this fall: interface themes, multiple tabs, extended onscreen keyboard and more!

## What Juno isn't
**Juno** isn't what [Computable](http://computableapp.com){:target="_blank"} used to be, and it doesn't allow running notebooks locally: you do need a notebook server that will do the actual computing. There are a lot of options for running a notebook server: it can be your own laptop in your local network, AWS node or even a dedicated powerful GPU-enabled machine configured as a public server, or accessible via VPN Tunneling.

## Public beta
With **Juno** AppStore release coming later this fall, today we are launching Juno public beta. If you would like to participate and try it out, simply [sign up here](/#mce-EMAIL){:target="_blank"} and don't forget to confirm your e-mail address. We will then send you instructions on how to install **Juno** build on your iPad. You will also get updates with new features as soon as they go live.

Please, keep in mind that you will need a remote Jupyter Notebook server to use the app, as it doesn't allow running notebooks locally. If you have a self-signed SSL certificate which doesn't work in Safari on iOS, take a look at our [step-by-step instructions](/ssl-self-signed-cert){:target="_blank"} on how to configure certificates and enable SSL, so that you are able to connect to your server from iPad. In case you still can't get it to work, please, check out [Jupyter documentation](http://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/public_server.html){:target="_blank"} on running a notebook server, or send an e-mail to [help@juno.sh](mailto:help@juno.sh).
