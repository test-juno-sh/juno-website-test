After months of making and beta testing Juno has finally made it to the AppStore! üéâ **Juno 1.1** is our first public release, featuring a revamped user interface that makes it much easier to work with your servers and notebooks on a touch device. <!--more-->

We would like to take this opportunity to thank all of our beta testers who helped us test Juno, and for following us on this fantastic journey. Over 1200 people participated in Juno beta, and finally launching it live couldn't be more thrilling to us! ü§ó 

## Juno and Juno Pro
Juno is going to be available for free, with an optional in-app purchase to unlock Juno Pro if you want to connect to an arbitrary Jupyter Notebook server, or use your cloud computing service account. **There will be no subscription, Juno Pro is going to be available as a one time purchase.** We did our best to make free version of Juno fun as well: you can play with introductory notebooks on Python, NumPy, Matplotlib and SciPy right out of the box without paying anything, those notebooks will be launched on a temporary server just for you using [Binder](https://mybinder.org) service. We plan to keep adding new intoductory notebooks in order to keep things interesting. üôÇ

## We Need Your Support
We honestly hope that Juno turns out to be a good fit for your workflow and that you find it useful. If you like Juno, keep in mind that **there are many ways to support its development** and keep it going:
