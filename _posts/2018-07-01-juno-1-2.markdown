**Juno 1.2** is out, and it is our first major update since hitting the AppStore! Juno is now a **universal app**, which means you can install it on both your iPhone _and_ iPad, bringing Jupyter to all mobile devices running iOS 10.3 or later. **Juno Pro** works for **all of your devices**, too: if you previously purchased Juno Pro on iPad, simply restore purchase on your iPhone. Juno supports same features on iPhone as the iPad version, so you will get full access to your Jupyter server wherever you are. <!--more-->

Other changes include:
* **Updated interface**. We updated the editor look and feel, so that it is just as easy to navigate on smaller iPhone screens.
* **JupyterLab servers fallback**. Although Juno is designed to work with Jupyter Notebook, it will now work with your JupyterLab servers by automatically requesting classic Notebook interface.
* **Resetting sessions**. You can now clear active web session for your JupyterHub server, or reset all web-based sessions initiated in Juno altogether.
* **Notebook web content fixes**. We fixed a bunch of bugs related to how notebooks handle external web content, which affected some of R plotting packages, embedded videos, cells requesting user input and a few other things. Thanks for reporting!
* **Notebook editing lag**. We fixed a number of issues related to typing lag while editing notebooks, which should improve things for majority of our users.
* **Bug fixes and performance improvements**. There are many smaller performance related improvements that might be less prominent, but should still make a difference altogether.

## Juno and Juno Pro
Juno is still available for free, with an optional in-app purchase to unlock Juno Pro if you want to connect to an arbitrary Jupyter server, or use your cloud computing service account â€” you only purchase it **once for all of your devices**! However, we did our best to make free version of Juno fun as well: you can play with introductory notebooks on Jupyter, Python, NumPy, Matplotlib and SciPy right out of the box without paying anything, those notebooks will be launched on a temporary server just for you using [Binder](https://mybinder.org) service. We plan to keep adding new intoductory notebooks in order to keep things interesting. ðŸ™‚
