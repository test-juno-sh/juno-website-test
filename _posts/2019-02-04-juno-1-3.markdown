**Juno 1.3** is out now, bringing a whole bunch of new features and bug fixes! Juno now supports [Binder](https://mybinder.org), a service for launching git repositories with notebooks as executable Jupyter environments: you can specify a GitHub or GitLab repo containingÂ Jupyter notebooks you would like to run, and it will be launched as a temporary Jupyter server in Juno. <!--more-->

Other changes include:

* **Kernel switcher**. You can now switch between kernels that are available on your server from the Kernel menu in notebook editor.
* **Improved Azure Notebooks integration**. Some new projects couldn't be accessed in Juno, now you should be able to launch all of them.
* **Improved CoCalc integration**. CoCalc connection should now be more reliable in terms of keeping your server alive, and all of your projects should now be displayed with correct status.
* **More control over your custom server**. You can now check the URL your custom server is loading and change it on the go: for instance, if your JupyterHub is using some non-conventional authentication.
* **Unsaved changes alerts**. Juno will now alert you when closing a notebook with unsaved changes, as well as display unsaved changes indicator while editing the notebook.
* **Fix for broken edit mode**. Sometimes Juno couldn't re-enter edit mode when switching between apps in iOS 12, this should now be properly detected and handled.
* **Optional Esc key binding**. You can now map Esc key to your hardware keyboard's Control or Option key, or disable mapping altogether.
* **Improved JupyterLab fallback detection**. Whenever you connect to a JupyterLab server, it should now be correctly identified and accessed via fallback Jupyter Notebook route.
* **Improved kernel reporting**. Previously Juno would sometimes fail to display notebook's kernel, this should now be fixed.
* **R markdown notebooks support**. R markdown files (.rmd) should now open in notebook editor as usual notebooks.
* **Basic HTTP Authentication support**. Juno will now allow you to authenticate against your Jupyter server if it's using Basic HTTP Authentication.
* **Bug fixes and performance improvements**. There are many smaller performance related improvements that might be less prominent, but should still make a difference altogether.

## Juno and Juno Pro
Juno is still available for free, with an optional in-app purchase to unlock Juno Pro if you want to connect to an arbitrary Jupyter server, or use your cloud computing service account â€” you only purchase it **once for all of your devices**! However, I did my best to make free version of Juno fun as well: you can play with introductory notebooks on Jupyter, Python, NumPy, Matplotlib and SciPy right out of the box without paying anything, those notebooks will be launched on a temporary server just for you using [Binder](https://mybinder.org) service. I plan to keep adding new intoductory notebooks in order to keep things interesting. ðŸ™‚

## Juno Needs Your Support
I honestly hope that Juno turns out to be a good fit for your workflow and that you find it useful. If you like Juno, keep in mind that **there are many ways to support its development** and keep it going:

* Consider leaving a positive [review on the AppStore](https://itunes.apple.com/app/juno-jupyter-notebook-client/id1315744137): this honestly means the world to me.
* [Check out Juno on Product Hunt](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/juno-767a5996-5c93-4d62-880d-14268d1093e5) and leave feedback: the more people hear about Juno the better.
* [Share your feedback](mailto:feedback@juno.sh) if you think Juno lacks or needs to improve something, or [get in touch](mailto:help@juno.sh) if you can't get it to work with your Jupyter server, I'll be happy to help. ðŸ™‚
